# Summary: 

* It appears to be a slight bias between paid and non-paid reviews with just a 4% difference with Vine reviewers being more likely to leave a 5-star review than non-Vine reviewers.

* I would suggest having a more deepened analysis of all reviews rather than just the 5 stars since it could provide more accurate results.
